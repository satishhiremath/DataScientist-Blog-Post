# DataScientist-Blog-Post

## Installation:

There is no dependent python libraries to run the code. Only Anaconda distribution of Python is necessary. Code should run without any issue using Python versions 3.x and above.
## Project Motivation:

This is an Udacity Nanodegree Data Scientist project. I chose FIFA 19 complete player data-set.

For me would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here as a football fan.

## Key interests would be:

Q1. Which clubs are the most economicalï¼Ÿ What is the ratio of total wages/ total potential for clubs?

Q2. How total market value distributed for nation team player?

Q3. Which player skils set influence potential/wage? Can we predict player/player's potential based on his skills set?

## File Descriptions:

data.csv contains latest edition FIFA 2019 players attributes including age, Nationality, potential, wage, etc.

To showcsae all work related to above three questions, notebook has been created.
## Results:

The key findings of the project can be found at the post https://medium.com/@satishrh.201/fifa-19-data-exploration-4008c0042a7a.
